# Flow Image Classification
> This repository contains the machine learning code used for my bachelor thesis with the title "Flow-based Traffic classification Using
Deep Vision". <br>
In this work we try to classify Malware/Benign network traffic flows using VGG and ResNet/NeXt architectures.
We do so by converting pcap files of such traffic to images using our own processing tool, which can be found at https://github.com/stefanDeveloper/heiFIP and then training our models on these.
